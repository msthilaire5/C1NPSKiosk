# NPS Kiosk
This repository is my submission for Capital One's Mind Sumo Challenge, as part of my application for the August Software Engineering Summit.

## Instructions
The first time you visit the kiosk, your browser should ask you to enter your API Key. Copy and paste the key given to you by the NPS and press Enter. Then, you can proceed to browse the app.

## Features Left to Implement
* Visitor Center and campgrounds detail lightboxes on park pages
* Events detail lightbox on Events and park pages
* Filtration by state, designation, and park
* Entire API search on Index page (as of 6/23/2019, search bar on index page does not do anything)
* Fix resBoxes for lesson plans, articles, people, places, and events so:
	* At least 300 px for Education section of park page.
	* Full width for Events section of park page.
* Pagination to show > 50 results (API default limit is 50)

## Skills Learned
* I got to brush up on my HTML and CSS!
* After being exposed to JSON through the #EarlyBird program, I learned how to process that data with Javascript
* I finally learned Javascript after ~10 years of planning to do so! Picked up jQuery and AJAX skills too!
