# NPS Kiosk
This repository is my submission for Capital One's Mind Sumo Challenge, as part of my application for the August Software Engineering Summit.

## Skills Learned
* I got to brush up on my HTML and CSS!
* After being exposed to JSON through the #EarlyBird program, I learned how to process that data with Javascript
* I finally learned Javascript after ~10 years of planning to do so! Picked up jQuery and AJAX skills too!
